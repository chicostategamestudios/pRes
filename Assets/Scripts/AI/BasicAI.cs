//This script was written by James | Last edited by James | Modified on September 5, 2017
//The purpose of this script is to have an enemy chase the player. This is implemented by using a Nav Mesh Agent.
//It will then decide what to do with its list of actions.

/* The way this script works is that it requires a nav mesh agent to follow the player. The ai will use the nav mesh when it is "alerted" 
 * so if you don't want the ai to follow the player anymore set "alerted" to false. Once the AI is within a certain distance
 * to the player, it will randomly decide whether to attack or dodge. If it attacks, it will access the BasicAI_Attack script.
